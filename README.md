Variant 7

Task 1:

Create a console application that meets the following requirements:

1. Use the capabilities of OOP: classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
2. Each class should have an exhaustive name and informative composition.
3. Inheritance should be applied only when it makes sense.
4. When coding, java code convention conventions should be used.
5. Classes should be properly organized into packages.
6. Working with the console or console menu should be minimal.
7. Files can be used to store initialization parameters.

Knight. Determine the hierarchy of the knight's ammunition. Equip the knight. Calculate the cost. Sort ammunition based on weight. Find items of ammunition corresponding to a given range of price parameters.



Task 2:

Create a text processing program for a programming textbook using classes (if necessary) to represent: a symbol, a word, a sentence, a punctuation mark, etc. In all tasks with text formation, replace tabs and sequences of spaces with one space. The program must process email addresses and phone numbers in the format +XXX(XX)XXX-XX-XX as separate words.

The words of the text starting with vowel letters are sorted alphabetically by the first consonant letter of the word.



Task 3:

1. Develop an XML document structure for your variant, describe it using XSD. Create an XML file corresponding to the developed XSD schema.
2. When developing XSD, use simple and complex types, enumerations, templates and limit values, it is mandatory to use attributes and type ID.
3. Create a Java class(classes) corresponding to the developed scheme.
4. Create a Java application for parsing an XML document and initializing a collection of objects with information from an XML file. To parse, use SAX, DOM or Sax parser. To sort objects, use the Comparator interface.
5. To check the correctness and validity of an XML document using XSD.

Edged weapons can be structured according to the following scheme:
1. Type – type (knife, dagger, saber, etc.).
2. Handy – one or two-handed.
3. Origin – country of manufacture.
4. Visual (there should be several) – visual characteristics: blade (blade length [10 – n cm], blade width [10 – n mm]), material (blade [steel, cast iron, copper, etc.]), handle (wood, plastic, metal), presence of a blood drain (there is or not).
5. Value – collectible or not.



Task 4
To develop a subsystem for working with the database of the proposed subject area:
1. Develop a database schema according to the subject area of your option. Create sql scripts for creating a database, a database user, creating tables, filling tables, deleting data, deleting tables, deleting databases, updating data, queries for data sampling.
2. Store information about the subject area in the database, use the JDBC API for access using a connection pool developed independently. MySQL is used as a DBMS.
3. Based on the entities of the subject area, create classes describing them.
4. Classes and methods should have names reflecting their functionality and should be competently structured by packages.
5. The design of the code must comply with the Java Code Convention.
6. The application must support working with Cyrillic (be multilingual), including when storing information in the database.
7. Perform event logging, that is, process information about exceptions and events in the system using Log4j 2.
8. The code must contain comments.

Airline system. The airline has a list of flights. The dispatcher forms a flight crew (pilots, navigator, radio operator, flight attendants) for the Flight. The administrator manages the list of flights.



Task 5
Build a web system (for the subject area in accordance with the task 4 option) that supports the specified functionality:

1. The application interface must support working with Cyrillic (be multilingual).
2. The application architecture must conform to the Model-View-Controller template.
3. When implementing business logic algorithms, use GoF templates: Factory Method, Command, Builder, Strategy, State, Observer etc.
4. Using servlets and JSP, implement the functionality proposed in the formulation of a specific task.
5. Use the JSTL library in JSP pages and develop your own tags.
6. Use sessions and filters when developing business logic.
7. The code must contain comments.
